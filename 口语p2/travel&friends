素材:云南 梅里雪山 朋友照顾

Two years ago, when I graduated fiom university, I went to Mount Kawa Karpo with my classmate Harry. The mountain is a revered peak located in Yunnan Province, standing at an impressive height of more than 6000 meters. It is famous for its majestic, snow-capped peaks and its spiritual significance in Tibetan Buddhism.

The trip is unforgettable and interesting. I can still remember me suffering from severe altitude sickness and feeling very desperate at that time. It was my friend Harry who took care of me all along the way and took me to the hospital. I believe I could never have made it to that destination without his help. After we got there, we witnessed the rare Golden Sunrise over the Mountain, an event that only occurs a few times a year. It is said that those who see this golden glow will be blessed with good luck throughout the year.

Anyway, the trip was so difficult that I almost lost my life. But with my friend's help, I managed to see the most majestic view I have ever seen. It is definitely an interesting place!
